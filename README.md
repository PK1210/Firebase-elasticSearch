# Adding elasticsearch to firebase

I have written a blog about it available at https://medium.com/@prajwalkrishnamaitin/adding-search-functionality-to-firebase-cloud-functions-using-elasticsearch-c40d3544d357?source=friends_link&sk=34c43f02a0bc551031775f81e081b112. Enjoy.


All cloud functions are written in index.js to deploy setup firebase-cli and run following command-

    firebase deploy --only functions



response
r1  = exact
r2  = wildcards
r3  = fuzzy
// async to

n = 1 , n = 2 , n = 3 //user sends

feed =
{
    pinned -> oldest first ->
    non-pinned -> 
}
